# SpamBot

this is a spam bot which utilizes  post requests to spam:

how to use it:
1. first go into discord, find the specific channel in the server you want to spam, click on the "gears" icon, and click "Integrations"
   next, copy the webhook for that channel.
2. run the python script (in vscode or repl.it?), and you will be prompted for the webhook, the text you want to spam, and the delay (for the delay you have to input a decimal!)
3. just copy and paste the webhook in the prompted field, and enter the information for the text and delay fields
4. i would recommend @everyone pings for maximum effect B)
